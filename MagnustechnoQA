Tester Role
----------
Tests application according to the requirement of the system.
-It can be verifying  the FRD doc from BA
-Making test artificacts (test strategy, test plan, test cases, bug reports)
-create test environment to check every new/changed build from developers, for it pull the prod to test env

service based company(wipro,tcs) work for product based company(microsoft,google)

project
-------
To address the business issues or business oppourtunity rounds of official and un-official meetings
among the business people (C level, Business Analyst). Once it looks feasible project initiation Document (PID) is created
to look overall project details by BA. 

Then PM is hired or selected  to plan for resources/times lines for the project. Then he will prepare Porject plan document
where very detail about the project resources are described. (time,team,risk,mitigation,cost)

SDLC
---
1. initiation (project initiation) // PID doc by BA
2. Requirement (user(URS doc and software (SRS doc)) //srs is base for dev and tester prepared by BA
3. Design (LOW and HIGH) // tech architech Technical DOC 
login // modules interact or may not interact to each other to make a functionality of sytem.
signup  //
4. Development
5. Testing (dev,tester,user all participate) 
dev= unit testing to own code to see works as per expected, end to end testing.
tester= feature testing, integration testing(module,db,log), System Testing (live mode)
user= user acceptancce testing
6.Maintenance (bug fix, upgrades)

Developement Metodologies
---------------------------
1. Water fall 
2. Agile (incremental and iterative model)
sprint time =time to realase product to market (should not be more then 2 to 4 weeks)
product backlog= holds all requirements(doc)
sprint backlog= left from previous sprint goes here (doc)

scrum master= role of master for cordination for team mgnt(role)
daily standup meeting (13 min to 30 min) to talk about blockers and their solutions (meeting)
restropective meeting ( what is good, what went wrong, what we could do for better) (meeting)


TEST CASE
----------
not to miss every cases for a functino we write test case.

used test mgnt tools (ALM) or excel first then upload

contains
testcase_ID   Descrption   Steps   Precondition     TestData   Expected   Actual      Result


JAVA BASICS
-----
download jdk, eclipse

1. hello world to show env.
2. variables,errors, debugging
3. functions,static, final,switch, if , else, loops
4. object, class (OOD concepts),Abstract, inheritance, polymorphism(overloading, overiding)
5. Threads
6.collections (arraylist, LinkedList, set,iterator), HashMap, HashTable

TestNG(needs jdk 5 or higher)  open source automated testing framework
------
TestNG developed in java
@annotation based
does not required main method
next generation of junit, not only tests unit or  a function  but tests unit,integration,end to end testing
Mulithreading testing can be done

Installing TestNG
----------------
help->marketplace->type TestNG and install

simple code
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
public class testNGBasic {
@Test
public void test(){
	System.out.println("test is started");	
}
}

xml is the base for testNG, default creation is 
suite is a group of test in multiple class
A single test can contain multiple classes
eg: 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="Default suite">
  <test verbose="2" name="Default test">
    <classes>
      <class name="san.com.testNGBasic"/>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Default test -->
</suite> <!-- Default suite -->


The default location of the above file can be copied to any project folder and run with testNG to view the
reports in eclipse editor. similarly we can add multiple classes inside <classes>.

TO view the report run the xml file and refresh the project to see a new folder created test_output where you
can run the .html file to see the result generated.

Fail report for test is generated in diff files which can be runned to check only failed section.
